#Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot set is a complex and beautiful shape that emerges when we repeatedly apply a simple process to points on the complex plane. Each point is tested to see whether it stays within a certain boundary or escapes to infinity when this process is applied. The points that stay within the boundary form the Mandelbrot set, which displays an intricate, self-similar structure with infinitely repeating patterns. This fractal is famous for its aesthetically pleasing and endlessly detailed design.

#Julia Set
The Julia set is a related fractal that is created using a similar process but with a twist. Instead of checking different points on the complex plane to see if they belong to the set, we fix a point and vary the starting position. The resulting pattern depends on the fixed point we choose. Julia sets can be connected, forming a single, unbroken shape, or disconnected, forming many isolated pieces. Each choice of the fixed point produces a different Julia set with unique and fascinating patterns.

#Relationship Between Mandelbrot and Julia Sets
The Mandelbrot set acts like a map that helps us understand the behavior of Julia sets. By selecting different points from within the Mandelbrot set, we can generate corresponding Julia sets. This means that each point in the Mandelbrot set is associated with a specific Julia set, and exploring the Mandelbrot set allows us to discover a variety of Julia sets with diverse and intricate designs.
